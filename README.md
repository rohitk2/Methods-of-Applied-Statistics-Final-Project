# Methods of Applied Statistics Final Project
For my final project, I analyzed a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#.

I was interested in how various factors affect student performance including family background, parent income and how students spend their time outside of school (including partying, drinking, dating, etc.) effect student performance in mathematics. The main goal of the project was to find the best model to explain NOT PREDICT student performance in math, given all these factors. I used collinearity, the correlational matrix and a function in R that selected models based on the Akaike Information Criterion to find the best model.
